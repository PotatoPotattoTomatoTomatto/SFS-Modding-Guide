The `Water_Rocket`component is responsible for managing the behavior of rockets in water. It inherits from `MonoBehaviour` and is attached to the `PartsHolder` gameobject of all rockets, as evidenced by the screenshot below:

Like `Aero_Rocket`, the `Water_Rocket` component contains a reference to the `Rocket` instance it is associated with.

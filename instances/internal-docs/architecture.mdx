# Architecture

The SFS Modding Guide is structured to provide comprehensive documentation for modders interested in creating mods for the game. The architecture of the guide is designed to be modular and easily navigable, allowing users to find the information they need quickly.

## Underlying Structure

The documentation is built using Docusaurus, a modern static site generator that allows for easy content management and organization. The guide is divided into 3 main `docs` instances.

The landing page of the site is the "Getting Started" section, which provides an introduction to modding in SFS and guides users through the initial steps of creating and installing mods. The landing page is located at the root URL (`/`), and this was achieved by configuring the `slug` in the frontmatter of the `getting-started/index.mdx` file.

### `docs` (Docs)

This section contains the main documentation for modders, including guides, tutorials, and reference materials. It is organized into various categories such as conventions, best practices, and specific modding topics.

This instance uses an empty base route path, meaning that its pages are accessible directly from the root URL. For example, the "Getting Started" section can be accessed at `/getting-started`.

### `api` (API Reference)

This section contains the automatically generated C# API documentation for the game's codebase. It is organized by namespaces, classes, structs, enums, interfaces, and delegates, providing detailed information about each component's purpose and functionality.
The API documentation is accessible under the `api` base route path, allowing users to easily find and reference the API details they need while modding.

### `internal-docs` (Internal Documentation)

This section contains documentation intended for contributors and maintainers of the SFS Modding Guide itself. It includes guidelines on contribution, documentation structure, style guides, and maintenance procedures.
The internal documentation is accessible under the `internal` base route path, ensuring that it is separate from the main modding content while still being easily reachable for those involved in maintaining the guide.

# Installing Necessary Software

In order to create custom parts, you must first install the necessary software. This includes:
 1. [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download)
     Custom part creation must be done in Unity, due to it being the engine that SFS was created in.

 2. [Modding Toolkit](https://jmnet.one/sfs/forum/index.php?attachments/modding-toolkit-601c9bd-compilefix-zip.147611/)
    All custom parts will be developed using the pre-built modules in this unity project. Make sure to extract the ZIP file after downloading.

 3. [Unity editor version 6000.1.1f1 or later](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive)
    To use the modding toolkit, you must install Unity editor version 6000.1.1f1 or any later version.

 4. [Odin Inspector](https://odininspector.com/)
    Odin Inspector must be enabled within the project while creating custom parts; otherwise, the toolkit will be filled with errors and will be unusable. To install it, create an account and download the free trial.
    Although it is meant to be a paid service, you can create multiple accounts to get more free trials if you really need to.

## Setting up the software
First, make sure that you have a Unity account and a license. if you don't have a license, then you must click "licenses",
!["Lincenses button"](https://github.com/PotatoPotattoTomatoTomatto/SFS-Modding-Guide/blob/main/static/gallery/Lincenses.png?raw=true)

"add license",

!["Free personal license" button](https://github.com/PotatoPotattoTomatoTomatto/SFS-Modding-Guide/blob/main/static/gallery/AddLicense.png?raw=true)

then select "get a free personal license".

Once you have confirmed that you have a license and have extracted the modding toolkit and Odin Inspector trial, press "add" in the top-right corner of the Unity Hub.

!["Add" button](https://github.com/PotatoPotattoTomatoTomatto/SFS-Modding-Guide/blob/main/static/gallery/Addproject.png?raw=true)

Select "add project from disk".

Then find the modding toolkit. When you open the toolkit,
you will see a message that tells you to enter safe mode; ignore it. You will also see that the console has many errors; ignore those too. Click on the "assets" button in the top menu, then "import package" and
"custom package".

Select the Odin Inspector trial. The errors should go away after you've done this. You can now begin to create your custom parts.
